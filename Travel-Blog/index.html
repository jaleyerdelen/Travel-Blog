                    Jeonju presents several historical sites to visit but the main ones are Jeonju Janok village and Gyeonggijeon shrine.
                    
                    Jeonju Hanok Village welcomes over 800 Korean traditional Houses located in a district of narrow alleys. While the rest
                    of the city has been industrialized, the Hanok village retains its historical charms and traditions of the past. It is
                    especially well-known for its beautiful roof curves. It is the biggest intact Hanok village of the country.
                    
                    Gyeonggijeon Shrine has been built in 1410 and holds the portrait of King Tae-jo , the founder and the first king of the
                    Joseon dynasty. You can find the King’s and his wife’s mortuary tablets here. The existing structure was remodeled in
                    1614. Besides, inside Gyeonggijeon, the portraits of other successive kings such as Sun-jong , Cheol-jong, Yeong-jo and
                    many others are on display.
                    The entrance of the shrine is surrounded by bamboos, giving a zen atmosphere to the place.
                    Jeonju is also famous for its peaceful atmosphere (that’s why we call it the “slow city”) and for its traditional Korean
                    food especially the bibimbap. Try it, sure you will like it!
